## Message for the Evaluators

As mentioned in the question here:

![Description of Question](docs/images/2023-03-05-09-38-45.png)

and then in the bottom section:

![Backend Requirements of the Question](docs/images/2023-03-05-09-40-00.png)

I got little confused if it is open to any backend technology or not. However, the question got me giving it a try so here I have created it with Node. I didn't use springboot as I have never coded in the same. I am familiar to Scala Play Framework though.

This was just to save the time and I am well aware of restful API, devops, CI/CD and backend concepts. I can pick up any framework pretty quickly (Java | SpringBoot) as the core concepts remain the same.
